## Random Forest

### About the Python implementation

GIL sucks. Time to move on to C++.

### C++ Implementation

#### [Is there a formula or rule for determining the correct sampSize for a randomForest?](http://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/24330/is-there-a-formula-or-rule-for-determining-the-correct-sampsize-for-a-randomfore)

* Larger size: overfit
* Smaller size: faster, but might not good eight
* Rule of thumb: same size as the dataset(with replacement, some rows will be sampled and some will not)

Notes: rule of thumb for number of sampled feature p is sqrt(P) where P is the total number of features.

#### [Cast vector<T> to vector<const T>](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2868485/cast-vectort-to-vectorconst-t)

No need to do that.

#### Quick way to parallelize for-loops

All you need is `#pragma omp parallel for`(the `i` should be intergral, not unsigned).

```cpp
int factorial(int n) {
    int ret = 1;
    for (int i = 1; i <= n; ++i)
        ret *= i;
    return ret;
}

int main(void) {
#pragma omp parallel for
    for (int i = 0; i < 50060; ++i) {
        factorial(20516);
    }
    return 0;
}
```

And this drops from 2.8s to 0.3s on my computer, wow!
