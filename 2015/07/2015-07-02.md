Today is CG Exam...

## CH5 Transformation

### Vectors

* Inner product: a scalar, |u||v|cos(theta), u.v = 0 <=> u is vertical to v
* Ourter product: a vector of length |u||v|sin(theta), vertical to the plane containing u and v
  * u x v = 0 means u is parallel to v
* Normal: n = u x v
  * Nx = UyVz - UzVy
  * Ny = UzVx - UxVz
  * Nz = UxVy - UyVx

### Convex

* The line segment connecting any two points on the object is also within the object
* For `P = a1P1 + a2P2 + ... + anPn`, if `a1 + a2 + ... + an = 1`, the result is the **affine convex combination** for P1, P2 , ..., Pn.
* And if ai >= 0, we get the **convex hull** for these points
  * The minimun convex containing these points

### Shapes

* Lines: P(a) = P0 + ad(a point and a vector and a parameter a)
  * Linear interpolation: P(t) = (1-t)A + tB
* Curves: P(a), non linear
* Surface: P(a, b): non linear
* Plane: 2 vectors or 3 points

### Homogeneous coordinate

* Confusion between vectors and points(points have an origin for reference)
* Add another dimension for the coordinates
  * w
  * The original 3-dimension coordinate is (x/w, y/w, z/w)
  * When w is 0, P is a vector
* In homogenous coordinate, a straight line through the origin is mapping to a point in 3-dimensional space

#### Coordinate transformation

* Use one basis to represent another
* a = MTb
* (P0, v1, v2, v3) and (Q0, u1, u2, u3)
* Add Q0 = y41v1 + y42v2 + y43v3 + P0
* Use M to compute the changes in the representation
  * Determined by 12 coefficients

#### Frame

* Change of the frame is defined by a 4 x 4 matrix
* World frame -> Camera frame
* Initially the world frame and the camera frame are the same

#### Affine transformation

* Remain linearity
* All affine transformations can be represented as matrix multiplications in homogeneous coordinates

### Translation

* P' = P + d
* P = [x, y, z, 1]T, P' = [x', y', z', 1], d = [dx, dy, dz, 0]
* Simply [x+dx, y+dy, z+dz, 1]
* The matrix

  ```
  1 0 0 dx
  0 1 0 dy
  0 0 1 dz
  0 0 0 1
  ```

### Rotation(counter-clockwise)

#### 2D

In 2D, use r, cos and sins...

The matrix

```
cos(theta) -sin(theta)
sin(theta) cos(theta)
```

#### Around z-axis(z coordinate unchanged)

Same as 2d, add two more identity

Notice the third column/row.

```
cos(theta) -sin(theta) 0 0
sin(theta) cos(theta)  0 0
0          0           1 0
0          0           0 1
```

#### Around x or y-axis(x or y coordinate unchanged)

X: notice the first column/row

```
1 0          0           0
0 cos(theta) -sin(theta) 0
0 sin(theta) cos(theta)  0
0 0          0           1 
```

Y: notice the second column/row, and the signs

```
cos(theta)  0 sin(theta)  0
0           1 0           0
-sin(theta) 0 cos(theta)  0
0           0 0           1 
```

#### Around some general axis through the origin

* Project the axis onto the three planes to get thetax, thetay, thetaz
* R(theta) = Rz(thetaz)Ry(thetay)Rz(thetay)
* It must be z, y, x. The order matters


#### Around some general axis not intersecting with the origin

* Move the fixed point of the vector(along the axis) to origin
* Rotate
* Move the point back

#### Tips

To rotate something around its center, translate it so that the center is at the origin, then rotate it, then translate it back

### Non-rigid Body Transformation

#### Scaling

```
sx 0  0  0
0  sy 0  0
0  0  sz 0
0  0  0  1
```

#### Shearing

TODO

### Transformations as matrices

* Q = M * P
* 4x4 matrices
* Product as composition
* The rightmost one is applied first
* Not commutative, but associative

### Inverse of transformations

* T-1(dx, dy, dz) = T(-dx, -dy, -dz)
* R-1(theta) = R(-theta)
* S-1(sx, sy, sz) = S(1/sx, 1/sy, 1/sz)

#### Quaternions

* For rotations
* Vector + scalar: (q0, q1, q2, q3) = (q0, q)
* i^2 + j^2 + k^2 = ijk = -1, q = q1i + q2j + q3k
* Operations
  * Addition: (p0 + q0, p + q)
  * Multiplication: (p0q0 - pq, q0p + p0q + pxq)
  * Magnitude: |a|^2 = q0^2 + q.q
  * Inverse: (q0, -q)/|a|^2
* When p0 = 0, p is the location of the point in space
* Rotation
  * When p0 = cos(theta/2), q = sin(theta/2)v and v has unit length, the quaternion is a **unit quaternion** r and r^(-1) = (cos(theta/2), -sin(theta/2)v)
  * Say p' = rp(r^(-1)), then it's a representation of the point `p` rotated `theta` degrees about `v`
* Can represents rotations(replace transformation matrices)
* Efficient, can be interpolated to create smooth rotation

## CH6 Viewing

### 2D

* screenSize/2 + (x-xCenter)*scaleFactor   (or y)

### Camera in OpenGL

#### Three phases in the pipeline

* Model-view transform
  * You can't actually transform the camera, you need to transform the scene
* Projection transformation
  * Set the lens
* Clipping
  * Frustum

#### Default

* Initial world frame and camera frame are the same
* Located at the origin
* Look at -z
* Frustum is a cube, side length 2(1+1), center at the origin

### View reference coordinates(uvn)

* n = -viewDirection
* u = upVector x n
* v = n x u
* Then you need to move this coordinate system to the view reference point
* After the coordinate system is defined, project the 3D world onto the view reference plane(uv)

### Projection

* When uvn is overlapped with xyz, the projection is very simple: ignore z-coordinate

#### View orientation matrix(World-to-view)

* Translate uvn by -vrp then reorient
* Effect: World coordinate to view coordinate
* V = R^(-1)T^(-1)
  * Normalized vectors
  * a = Peye - Plook
  * r = up x a
  * u = a x r

```
|rx ry rz 0|1 0 0 -eyex|   |rx ry rz -r.vrp|(u)
|ux uy uz 0|0 1 0 -eyey|   |ux uy uz -u.vrp|(v)
|ax ay az 0|0 0 1 -eyez|  =|ax ay az -a.vrp|(n)
|0  0  0  1|0 0 0 1    |   |0  0  0  1     |
```

#### View-to-world transform matrix

E = TR

```
|1 0 0 eyex|rx ux ax 0|   |rx ux ax eyex|
|0 1 0 eyey|ry uy ay 0|   |ry uy ay eyey|
|0 0 1 eyez|rz uz az 0|  =|rz uz az eyez|
|0 0 0 1   |0  0  0  1|   |0  0  0  1   |
```

### Orthognal Projection

1. World-to-view(View orientation matrix)
2. Parallel projection(make z=0)
3. use u and v

```
   (2)       (1)
|1 0 0 0|ux uy uz -ru.vrp|
|0 1 0 0|vx vy vz -rv.vrp|
|0 0 0 0|nx ny nz -rn.vrp|
|0 0 0 1|0  0  0  1      |
```

### Perspective Projection

* prp(in view coordinate) on the axis passing though the center of the view window(on the view plane) and parallel to n
* d is the distance between prp and the view plane
* This will make w=1 -> w=z/d
  * Note that when w!=1, you have to divide x, y and z by it. So later you will have
    * x = xd/z
    * y = yd/z
    * z = d
* This is not linear, but will keep the lines
* Non-inversible

1. World-to-view
2. Translate the center of the view to the origin(by -cx, -cy where cx and cy are coordinates for the center of the view window)
3. Perspective projection
4. 2D viewing transform(u and v)

```
    (3)       (2)         (1)
|1 0 0   0|1 0 0 -cx|ux uy uz -ru.vrp|
|0 1 0   0|0 1 0 -cy|vx vy vz -rv.vrp|
|0 0 1   0|0 0 1  0 |nx ny nz -rn.vrp|
|0 0 1/d 0|0 0 0  1 |0  0  0  1      |
```

### Tips

The volume is made finite by specifying the front and back clipping plane


## CH7 Clipping 

### 2D lines

1. Both vertices are in the window: original line
2. Both outside and at the same side of an edge: discard
3. One inside, one outside: at least calculate intersections once
4. Both outside, but not at the same side of an edge: at least calculate intersections once

### Cohen-Sutherland Clipping

* Mask for ymin, ymax, xmax, xmin(out = 1, in = 0)
* o1 | o2 == 0: inside
* o1 & o2 != 0: outside
* o1 & o2 == 0: could be one of them
  * Find an intersection to replace one endpoint
* 3D: 6bit


### Sutherland-Hodgeman

* Draw edges, leave the parts that are inside, and connect the endpoints finally

### Tips

* Bounding box
* Re-triangulation

### Hidden Surface Removal

#### Image Space Method

* Per pixel/fragment scan conversion
* Faster, resolution dependent
* Z-Buffer/Depth-buffer

```
for each pixel in the image:
  connect the pixel and the viewpoint
  find the nearest object
  compute the color
```
* O(nN)

#### Z-buffer

```
Initialize frame buffer
Initialize z-buffer(by zmax)
For each polygon in the world:
  For each pixel in the polygon
    compute z(x, y)
    if z(x, y) > zbuffer(x, y):
      Compute i(x, y)
      frameBuffer(x, y) = i(x, y)
      zbuffer(x, y) = z(x, y)
```

* Simple, easy
* Arbitrary traversal, handles interpenetration
* Cons
  * Poor for high depth complexity
  * Shared edges/overlaps
  * Memory requirement
  * Hard to do transparency

#### Object Space Method

* Per object, before scan conversion
* Independent of resolution

```
for each object in the world:
  find unobstructed parts of objects
  draw those parts
```
* O(n2)

#### Back face culling

* n.v < 0: invisible
* n.v > 0: visible

## CH8 Lighting

### Illumination model

* Local illumination - fast
* Global illumination - slow

### Light sources

* Point light
  * All direction equally from a point
  * Inversely proportional to distance
* Parallel light(directional light)
  * Same angles
* Ambient light
  * From all direction
  * Simulate bouncing
  * Ireflected = kambient * Iambient
* Spot light
  * Falloff

### Type of reflection

* Specular
  * Highlights
  * Same angles(snell's law)
  * Add falloff to simulate
  * Ispecular = ks * Ilight * (v.r)^(nshiny)
    * v is unit vector towards the viewer, r is the ideal reflection direction
* Diffuse
  * Rough
  * Equal in all direction
  * The smaller the angle between L and N, the brighter(proportional to cos)
  * Idiffuse = kd * Ilight * (n.l) (n and l are normalized)
* Phong
  * Ambient + diffuse + specular
  * I = Ka * Ia + sum(Ii(kd * (n.l) + ks * (v.y^)n))

### Lighting v.s. Shading

* Lighting: compute luminous intensity at **3D points**
* Shading: compute colors for pixels

### Shading

* Flat
  * Once per polygon
  * Not smooth, but very fast
* Gouraud
  * Compute normals for each vertex, then color for each vertex, then interpolate colors for other pixels
  * Interpolate **colors** along edges(on)/scan line(inside)
  * Mach bands
* Phong
  * Compute averaged vertex normals(by face normals), then interpolate **normals** for each pixel, then calculate colors
  * Expensive
  * Natural

## CH9 Texturing

### Polygonal texture mapping

* 2D -> 2D
* Map pixels to polygons, then map polygons  to texture map
* Weighted average

### Two-part mapping

* Map the texture to a simple intermediate surface, then map to the object
* Cube mapping
  * Easy for simple orthographic projection
  * Environmen maps
* Cylinder mapping
* SpherICAL mapping

### Mipmap

* Precomputed levels of detail
* Use the one that matches the polygon apparent size best

### Other techniques

* Environment mapping
  * Reflections
  * Reflected ray
* Bump mapping
  * Perturbing normal vectors
  * Bumps
* Displacement mapping
  * Change the actual geometric position
  * Height map, texture map

## CH10 Mesh

### Adjacent matrix

  2. Face, vertices(f1, (v1, v2, v3))
  3. Ajdacent matrix for vertices
* Properties
  * Query vertices of face: O(1)
  * Query adjacency of vertices: O(1)
  * Query adjacency of faces: O(F)
* Pro
  * Info about adjacency
  * Stores non-manifold meshes
* Cons
  * No connection from vertices to faces

### Half-edge

* 3 tables
  1. Vertices, coordinates, a half-edge starting with it
  2. Faces, a half-edge that borders it
  3. Half-edges, starting vertex, opposite half-edges, face, next edge(, optional previous edge)
* Traversal
  * Start with one vertex
  * Outgoing half-edge
  * Opposite half-edge
  * Next half-edge
  * Opposite half-edge
  * Next....
* Traverse vertices:
  ```
  half_edge = vertex->edge;
  do {
    half_dege = half_edge->opposite->next;
    vertex = half_edge->start;
    // do something
  } while (half_edge != vertex->half_edge)
  ```


## CH11 Subdivision

* Type
  * Approximating: remove original vertices
  * Interpolating: keep original vertices
* Why
  * LOD
  * Compression
  * Smooth
* Valences: number of edges adjacent to the vertex
* Regular
  * For quads, valence = 4
  * For triangles, valence = 6
  * Extraordinary: valence > 4(quad)/6(tri.)
* Process
  * Add new vertices
  * Adjust the vertices by some rules

### Loop Subdivision(triangles)

* Insert new points(linear combinations of old)
* Update point positions(linear combinations of adjacent points)

### Butterfly Subdivision(triangles)

* Some inherit old locations
* Some computed by another mask

### Catmull-Clark Subdivision(polygons)

* Calculate some points inside polygons
* Calculate some points on the edge by using the previous points
* Update some points
