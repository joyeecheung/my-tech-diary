## Languages

### [Panel: Systems Programming in 2014 and Beyond](https://channel9.msdn.com/Events/Lang-NEXT/Lang-NEXT-2014/Panel-Systems-Programming-Languages-in-2014-and-Beyond)

* What is a system programming language
  * Deal with hardware
  * Complexity
  * Resource constraints
  * Fine-grained control
* Security
  * Security and type safety, memory safety .etc. are not the same
  * Ensure/Inference security aspects of your application by using the type safety, .etc. properties that provided by the language
  * Emerging tools that can prove the correctness of your code at some level
* Language features being too complicated
  * Code transformation - port your old code to the new syntax, so the language can evolve better
  * e.g. `go fix` parse the code, take the AST, then fix it, write it out in the new form. This helped when upgrading the protocol buffer API
* Hot patching
  * It's not what languages should care about..
  * Fail quickly and restart fast like Erlang -- why bother with the dynamic   patching anyway?
* Compile time takes forever
  * Try Scala :)
  * Recompiling headers takes up too much time
  * Rust just compiles(with concatenation?) the whole compilation unit(crate) into one big tree, so there's no unnecessary recompilation
* ABI
  * Why C++ still doesn't have it: policies
    * Every big player wants to own it
    * A standard will break existing code on at least one platform
    * It doesn't seem appropriate for the committee to standardize it
  * You need to consider the balance between the room for optimization and compatibility
  * Provide a mechanism for the compiler to know if it has the freedom to rearrange the layout(like POD in C++)
  * New languages still need to align with C/C++ when the code need to communicate with them

## Tricks

### HTTPS migration

* Overwrite `HTMLElement.prototype.appendChild` and `HTMLElement.prototype.insertBefore` to modify every script loading request(replace `http://` in `src` with `https://`)
* Overwrite `XMLHttpRequest.prototype.open` to modify every AJAX request
