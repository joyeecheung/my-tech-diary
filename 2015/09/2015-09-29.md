#### Owners and pointers

* No pointer can outlive the scope of the owner it points to
* An owner is responsible for owners in its object
* Special cases
  * The owner of an **object on the free store** is **a pointer**
  * The owner of an **object on the stack the owner** is **itself**
  * The owner of a **static object** is **itself**
* No-nos
  * Don't delete non-owner
  * Don't assign object to non-owner(e.g. `new` to a raw pointer which don't have any automatic cleanup)

#### Ownership

* High-level: use abstraction e.g. smart pointer
  * Not always applicable: need some rewriting, might slow things down
* Low-level: mark it `owner` and let the tools do the work
